# 🎵 Beatoven Launcher  
A modern, fast and customizable game & app launcher built with passion.

Beatoven is our own vision of what a launcher should be: clean, lightweight, powerful, and fun to use.  
We wanted something that doesn’t feel bloated, slow, or full of ads — so we built Beatoven.

### 🎨 Customizable UI
Themes, colors, icons — make the launcher truly yours.  
Beatoven adapts to your style instead of forcing one on you.

Perfect for developers or hobbyists who want control.

### 🕹️ Game & App Management
Add, organize, and launch anything from one place:

- Custom shortcuts  
- External launchers

## 🥁 Why "Beatoven"?

Because we mix performance and creativity — like Beethoven mixed music and genius.  
Beatoven is about *rhythm, control and power*, all in one launcher.

## 🆚 How Beatoven Compares to Other Launchers

We respect other launchers — every project has strengths — but they often have issues like:

### ❌ Heavy, slow startup  
Many launchers load dozens of background services. Beatoven keeps things minimal.

### ❌ Too many ads or unwanted features  
Beatoven stays clean and focused. No ads. No distracting popups.

### ❌ Limited customization  
Beatoven gives users freedom: themes, layouts, icons, and more.

### ❌ Closed ecosystems  
Beatoven accepts *anything*: games, apps, tools, even custom scripts.

Beatoven isn’t here to replace everything —  
it’s here to **give you control again**.
